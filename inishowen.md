## Mamore Gap

Mamore Gap was once the sole gateway between Buncrana and Urris. This steep meandering road is sheltered 700 feet on either side by the hill of Mamore on the east and on the west the hill of Craogh Carragh. To the north east Raghtin More stands 1657 feet in the distance. These hills are only a small feature of glacier deposits and formations which are abundant in this area and other local imprints of the Ice Age date back to 15000 BC.

## Grianán of Aileach

The Stone Fort of Grianán of Aileach is sits on a hilltop in Inishowen County Donegal. 250m above sea level, the stone fort was probably first built on an earthen rath. 

The view from Aileach is breathtaking. The glistening waters of Lough Foyle and Lough Swilly are clear, as is the form of the entire peninsula. A windy and exposed place, Grianán has been a silent witness to the history of Ireland.
